# Make Angular Great Again

Angular is a powerful UI framework with a lot of options on how to move data around -- sometimes too many. This
repo will have a few tags demonstrating some of the different ways to pass data around, as well as their pros and cons.

Ideally this repo would serve those familiar with other UI frameworks like React, AngularJS and JQuery with some
examples on how to pass data around and what level of abstraction is appropriate given the scale of your application.

  <h3>~ Our Mission Statement ~</h3>
  Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death.
  I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
  I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls.
  I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,
  for this night and all the nights to come.
